# Study Drill - Break / Fix eachother's Python Files

## Here's What You Do:

1.  Find all the errors in my python/ex6.py file
2.  Use python/solutions/ex6.txt as the file to test against.  
  * What this means, is the unbroken or 'debugged' version of ex6.py will give the output that can be found on the python/solutions/ex6.txt file.  
  * Hint, I created that file by running the command:
    ```bash
    python3 python/ex6.py > python/solutions/ex6.txt
    ```
3.  Fork this branch into your personal github repository and checkout the branch to your local machine.  Then, do the following for each bug you find:
  * Create a commit for 1 bug and include a message about the bug in the commit message
  * I think I have about 5-6 bugs, (I'm guessing, I can't rememebr) so I would expect 5-6 commits added onto this branch.  
  * Then, when all the bugs have been found and you can get the same solutions/ex6.txt file that I have.. 
  * Create a Pull-Request and I'll be able to see the bug fixes you've proposed and make a decision whether or not to take your code as the fix for my branch.
