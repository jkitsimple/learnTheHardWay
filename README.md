Learning how to use GitHub & Programming Languages with Zed Shaw's 'Learn The Hard Way' book series

Quote from the author concerning this repository:

    __"These solutions are better for when you are totally stuck.  Don't just come here to get the answer 
    at the first sign of trouble.  Instead, work really hard to figure it out on your own and then 
    only when you are at the edge of your sanity come take a peek. Ideally, your first step should be 
    to print every variable to figure out the problem."__
